# YOLO

## Preprocessing
- We only used bounding boxes and detailed clothing attributes for training YOLO
    - We needed bounding boxes for each clothings, and detailed attributes for detected clothings. Therefore, we only used bounding boxes and detailed attributes in labels. 
    - To achieve this, we performed preprocessing converting the dataset into the format suitable for YOLO training.
